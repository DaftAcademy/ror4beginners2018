module Bootsnap
  module LoadPathCache
    # LoadedFeaturesIndex partially mirrors an internal structure in ruby that
    # we can't easily obtain an interface to.
    #
    # This works around an issue where, without bootsnap, *ruby* knows that it
    # has already required a file by its short name (e.g. require 'bundler') if
    # a new instance of bundler is added to the $LOAD_PATH which resolves to a
    # different absolute path. This class makes bootsnap smart enough to
    # realize that it has already loaded 'bundler', and not just
    # '/path/to/bundler'.
    #
    # If you disable LoadedFeaturesIndex, you can see the problem this solves by:
    #
    # 1. `require 'a'`
    # 2. Prepend a new $LOAD_PATH element containing an `a.rb`
    # 3. `require 'a'`
    #
    # Ruby returns false from step 3.
    # With bootsnap but with no LoadedFeaturesIndex, this loads two different
    #   `a.rb`s.
    # With bootsnap and with LoadedFeaturesIndex, this skips the second load,
    #   returning false like ruby.
