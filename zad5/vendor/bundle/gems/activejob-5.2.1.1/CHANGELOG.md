## Rails 5.2.1.1 (November 27, 2018) ##

*   Do not deserialize GlobalID objects that were not generated by Active Job.

    Trusting any GlobaID object when deserializing jobs can allow attackers to access
    information that should not be accessible to them.

    Fix CVE-2018-16476.

## Rails 5.2.1 (August 07, 2018) ##

*   Pass the error instance as the second parameter of block executed by `discard_on`.

    Fixes #32853.

## Rails 5.2.0 (April 09, 2018) ##

*   Allow block to be passed to `ActiveJob::Base.discard_on` to allow custom handling of discard jobs.

    Example:

        class RemoteServiceJob < ActiveJob::Base
          discard_on(CustomAppException) do |job, exception|
            ExceptionNotifier.caught(exception)
          end

          def perform(*args)
            # Might raise CustomAppException for something domain specific
          end
        end

*   Support redis-rb 4.0.
