## Rails 5.2.1 (August 07, 2018) ##

*   Prevent `?null=` being passed on JSON encoded test requests.

    `RequestEncoder#encode_params` won't attempt to parse params if
    there are none.

    So call like this will no longer append a `?null=` query param.

        get foos_url, as: :json

    *Alireza Bashiri*

*   Ensure `ActionController::Parameters#transform_values` and
    `ActionController::Parameters#transform_values!` converts hashes into
    parameters.

    *Kevin Sjöberg*

*   Fix strong parameters `permit!` with nested arrays.

    Given:
    ```
    params = ActionController::Parameters.new(nested_arrays: [[{ x: 2, y: 3 }, { x: 21, y: 42 }]])
    params.permit!
    ```

    `params[:nested_arrays][0][0].permitted?` will now return `true` instead of `false`.

    *Steve Hull*

*   Reset `RAW_POST_DATA` and `CONTENT_LENGTH` request environment between test requests in
    `ActionController::TestCase` subclasses.

    *Eugene Kenny*

*   Output only one Content-Security-Policy nonce header value per request.

    Fixes #32597.

    *Andrey Novikov*, *Andrew White*

*   Only disable GPUs for headless Chrome on Windows.

    It is not necessary anymore for Linux and macOS machines.

    *Stefan Wrobel*

*   Fix system tests transactions not closed between examples.

## Rails 5.2.0 (April 09, 2018) ##

*   Check exclude before flagging cookies as secure.

    *Catherine Khuu*

*   Always yield a CSP policy instance from `content_security_policy`

    This allows a controller action to enable the policy individually
    for a controller and/or specific actions.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add the ability to disable the global CSP in a controller, e.g:

        class LegacyPagesController < ApplicationController
          content_security_policy false, only: :index
        end

    *Andrew White*

*   Add alias method `to_hash` to `to_h` for `cookies`.
    Add alias method `to_h` to `to_hash` for `session`.

    *Igor Kasyanchuk*

*   Update the default HSTS max-age value to 31536000 seconds (1 year)
    to meet the minimum max-age requirement for https://hstspreload.org/.

    *Grant Bourque*

*   Add support for automatic nonce generation for Rails UJS.

    Because the UJS library creates a script tag to process responses it
    normally requires the script-src attribute of the content security
    policy to include 'unsafe-inline'.

    To work around this we generate a per-request nonce value that is
    embedded in a meta tag in a similar fashion to how CSRF protection
    embeds its token in a meta tag. The UJS library can then read the
    nonce value and set it on the dynamically generated script tag to
    enable it to execute without needing 'unsafe-inline' enabled.

    Nonce generation isn't 100% safe - if your script tag is including
    user generated content in someway then it may be possible to exploit
    an XSS vulnerability which can take advantage of the nonce. It is
    however an improvement on a blanket permission for inline scripts.

    It is also possible to use the nonce within your own script tags by
    using `nonce: true` to set the nonce value on the tag, e.g

        <%= javascript_tag nonce: true do %>
          alert('Hello, World!');
        <% end %>

    Fixes #31689.

    *Andrew White*

*   Matches behavior of `Hash#each` in `ActionController::Parameters#each`.

    *Dominic Cleal*

*   Add `Referrer-Policy` header to default headers set.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Changed the system tests to set Puma as default server only when the
    user haven't specified manually another server.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Add secure `X-Download-Options` and `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` to
    default headers set.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Add headless firefox support to System Tests.

    *bogdanvlviv*

*   Changed the default system test screenshot output from `inline` to `simple`.

    `inline` works well for iTerm2 but not everyone uses iTerm2. Some terminals like
    Terminal.app ignore the `inline` and output the path to the file since it can't
    render the image. Other terminals, like those on Ubuntu, cannot handle the image
    inline, but also don't handle it gracefully and instead of outputting the file
    path, it dumps binary into the terminal.

    Commit 9d6e28 fixes this by changing the default for screenshot to be `simple`.

    *Eileen M. Uchitelle*

*   Register most popular audio/video/font mime types supported by modern browsers.

    *Guillermo Iguaran*

*   Fix optimized url helpers when using relative url root.

    Fixes #31220.

    *Andrew White*

*   Add DSL for configuring Content-Security-Policy header.

    The DSL allows you to configure a global Content-Security-Policy
    header and then override within a controller. For more information
    about the Content-Security-Policy header see MDN:

    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy

    Example global policy:

        # config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
        Rails.application.config.content_security_policy do |p|
          p.default_src :self, :https
          p.font_src    :self, :https, :data
          p.img_src     :self, :https, :data
          p.object_src  :none
          p.script_src  :self, :https
          p.style_src   :self, :https, :unsafe_inline
        end

    Example controller overrides:

        # Override policy inline
        class PostsController < ApplicationController
          content_security_policy do |p|
            p.upgrade_insecure_requests true
          end
        end

        # Using literal values
        class PostsController < ApplicationController
          content_security_policy do |p|
            p.base_uri "https://www.example.com"
          end
        end

        # Using mixed static and dynamic values
        class PostsController < ApplicationController
          content_security_policy do |p|
            p.base_uri :self, -> { "https://#{current_user.domain}.example.com" }
          end
        end

    Allows you to also only report content violations for migrating
    legacy content using the `content_security_policy_report_only`
    configuration attribute, e.g;

        # config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb
        Rails.application.config.content_security_policy_report_only = true

        # controller override
        class PostsController < ApplicationController
          content_security_policy_report_only only: :index
        end

    Note that this feature does not validate the header for performance
    reasons since the header is calculated at runtime.

    *Andrew White*

*   Make `assert_recognizes` to traverse mounted engines.

    *Yuichiro Kaneko*

*   Remove deprecated `ActionController::ParamsParser::ParseError`.

    *Rafael Mendonça França*

*   Add `:allow_other_host` option to `redirect_back` method.

    When `allow_other_host` is set to `false`, the `redirect_back` will not allow redirecting from a
    different host. `allow_other_host` is `true` by default.

    *Tim Masliuchenko*

*   Add headless chrome support to System Tests.

    *Yuji Yaginuma*

*   Add ability to enable Early Hints for HTTP/2

    If supported by the server, and enabled in Puma this allows H2 Early Hints to be used.

    The `javascript_include_tag` and the `stylesheet_link_tag` automatically add Early Hints if requested.

    *Eileen M. Uchitelle*, *Aaron Patterson*

*   Simplify cookies middleware with key rotation support

    Use the `rotate` method for both `MessageEncryptor` and
    `MessageVerifier` to add key rotation support for encrypted and
    signed cookies. This also helps simplify support for legacy cookie
    security.

    *Michael J Coyne*

*   Use Capybara registered `:puma` server config.

    The Capybara registered `:puma` server ensures the puma server is run in process so
    connection sharing and open request detection work correctly by default.

    *Thomas Walpole*

*   Cookies `:expires` option supports `ActiveSupport::Duration` object.

        cookies[:user_name] = { value: "assain", expires: 1.hour }
        cookies[:key] = { value: "a yummy cookie", expires: 6.months }

    Pull Request: #30121

    *Assain Jaleel*

*   Enforce signed/encrypted cookie expiry server side.

    Rails can thwart attacks by malicious clients that don't honor a cookie's expiry.

    It does so by stashing the expiry within the written cookie and relying on the
    signing/encrypting to vouch that it hasn't been tampered with. Then on a
    server-side read, the expiry is verified and any expired cookie is discarded.

    Pull Request: #30121

    *Assain Jaleel*

*   Make `take_failed_screenshot` work within engine.

    Fixes #30405.

    *Yuji Yaginuma*

*   Deprecate `ActionDispatch::TestResponse` response aliases.

    `#success?`, `#missing?` & `#error?` are not supported by the actual
    `ActionDispatch::Response` object and can produce false-positives. Instead,
    use the response helpers provided by `Rack::Response`.

    *Trevor Wistaff*

*   Protect from forgery by default

    Rather than protecting from forgery in the generated `ApplicationController`,
    add it to `ActionController::Base` depending on
    `config.action_controller.default_protect_from_forgery`. This configuration
    defaults to false to support older versions which have removed it from their
    `ApplicationController`, but is set to true for Rails 5.2.

    *Lisa Ugray*

*   Fallback `ActionController::Parameters#to_s` to `Hash#to_s`.

    *Kir Shatrov*

*   `driven_by` now registers poltergeist and capybara-webkit.

    If poltergeist or capybara-webkit are set as drivers is set for System Tests,
    `driven_by` will register the driver and set additional options passed via
    the `:options` parameter.

    Refer to the respective driver's documentation to see what options can be passed.

    *Mario Chavez*

*   AEAD encrypted cookies and sessions with GCM.

    Encrypted cookies now use AES-GCM which couples authentication and
    encryption in one faster step and produces shorter ciphertexts. Cookies
    encrypted using AES in CBC HMAC mode will be seamlessly upgraded when
    this new mode is enabled via the
    `action_dispatch.use_authenticated_cookie_encryption` configuration value.

    *Michael J Coyne*

*   Change the cache key format for fragments to make it easier to debug key churn. The new format is:

        views/template/action.html.erb:7a1156131a6928cb0026877f8b749ac9/projects/123
              ^template path           ^template tree digest            ^class   ^id

    *DHH*

*   Add support for recyclable cache keys with fragment caching. This uses the new versioned entries in the
    `ActiveSupport::Cache` stores and relies on the fact that Active Record has split `#cache_key` and `#cache_version`
    to support it.

    *DHH*

*   Add `action_controller_api` and `action_controller_base` load hooks to be called in `ActiveSupport.on_load`

    `ActionController::Base` and `ActionController::API` have differing implementations. This means that
    the one umbrella hook `action_controller` is not able to address certain situations where a method
    may not exist in a certain implementation.

    This is fixed by adding two new hooks so you can target `ActionController::Base` vs `ActionController::API`

    Fixes #27013.
